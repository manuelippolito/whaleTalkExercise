# whaleTalkExercise
In this JavaScript project I've used JavaScript variables, Arrays, Arrays Methods, Loops to complete the exercise.
The goal was to write a string and translate to a "whale talk". Whale use vowals to speak, so through JavaScript I've translated my string into a whale's way to speak.
A few rules that I have been instructed to follow were:
1. There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
2. The `u`‘s and `e`‘s are extra long, so I must double them in our program.
